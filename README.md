# SVG Viewer

**SVG Viewer** is a lightweight, Windows-only application built to view SVG images. Unlike other image formats, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) requires a specialized viewer. This app allows users to easily open and view SVG files while preserving their vector properties.

## Features

- View SVG files with full resolution.
- Specifically built for **Windows**.
- Lightweight and fast, with no unnecessary bloat.

## Installation

1. **Download the latest release**:  
   You can download the latest pre-built version of the app from the [releases page](https://github.com/your-username/svg-viewer/releases) (if available).

2. **Run the application**:  
   After downloading, simply run the executable file (`.exe`) to launch the app.

## Usage

- **Open SVG Files**: Once the app is launched, you can open SVG files either via the file dialog or by dragging and dropping them into the app window.
- The app will render the SVG file with full resolution and maintain its vector properties, ensuring scalability without quality loss.

# SVG Viewer

**SVG Viewer** is a simple Windows-only application built with Flutter to view SVG images. Unlike other image formats, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is not natively supported for viewing in some applications, and this tool solves that problem by allowing users to easily open and view SVG files.

Built with Flutter 3.13.2, this app offers a lightweight and straightforward solution for SVG image viewing on Windows.

## Features

- **View SVG files**: Open and view SVG images with full resolution.
- **Windows-only application**: Designed specifically for Windows users.
- **Flutter-based**: Built using Flutter 3.13.2 for a fast, responsive UI.
- **Lightweight**: No unnecessary bloatâ€”just a tool for viewing SVG images as they are.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need:
